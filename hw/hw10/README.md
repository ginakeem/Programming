Interactive Cloud

The interactive cloud is a cloud shaped light that changes color and flickering with every touch; with every touch, a different storm sound will happen.


Summary

The goal of my project is to create a light that is shaped like a cloud that emulates a storm cloud through lights. This is an interactive light and will change light mode with every touch. In addition, it will emit a different storm/rain sound with every touch to correspond with the light mode. With this project, I want to create an object that will add to an environment and create an atmosphere. The lights will emulate storms. Lights that slowly change color and fade into one another are similar to rolling clouds. Rapid, flickering lights act as rain falling fast. 

This light will be interactive with touch or motion sensors. Users can touch a certain part of the light to activate the program and change the light. If it with touch motion sensors, it will create an experience for users by walking past a single light fixure, or multiple. 


Component Parts

I will need to buy led or neopixel lights, cotton for the exterior of the cloud, a container/jar for the lights.
I will also need the Arduino, wires, sensors, resistors.

All of the lights will be outputs while the main input is the power source and control piece. 


Challenges

Configuring the lights to have different modes be a challenge because there will be multiple lights withinn a single mode. Once that part is figured out, coding the other modes should be easy. Also, figuring out how to make the lights change mode with every touch/move along with a sound sounds difficult to do. 


Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible!

Week 1: Write proposal
Week 2: Buy supplies, configure lights
Week 3: Continue to configure lights, figure out light mode, add sounds if time permits
Week 4: Build the exterior of the lights
Week 5: Present!
