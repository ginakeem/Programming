What is one major advantage of using an object instead of multiple variables?
  An object is more concise and can be retrieved faster, with less lines of text. Multiple variables can get confusing and       require many different names. 

What is the role of the parameters of a function?
  It is like giving a different set of instructions/rules to the same function. Functions are reusable and modular; you can     give them different parameters depending on what you want to achieve. 

What does it mean for a function to "return" something?
  The function is done executing and will evaluate into a number.
