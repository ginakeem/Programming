Why can you only use certain pins for analogWrite()?

You can only use certain pins for analogWrite() because the numbers with the tilda next to it indicate that it can be adjusted. without the tilda, the value is fixed and cannot be changed. 

What is the range the map() function maps the value to? Why this range?

It does not contrain to within the range because sometimes out of range numbers are useful or needed. It gets numbers from within these constraints but is not limited to.
